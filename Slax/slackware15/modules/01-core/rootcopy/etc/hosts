#
# hosts		This file describes a number of hostname-to-address
#		mappings for the TCP/IP subsystem.  It is mostly
#		used at boot time, when no name servers are running.
#		On small systems, this file can be used instead of a
#		"named" name server.  Just add the names, addresses
#		and any aliases to this file...
#

# For loopbacking.
127.0.0.1	localhost
::1		localhost
# Same thing for the default hostname if nothing was set up by netconfig:
127.0.0.1	slax.example.net slax
::1		slax.example.net slax

# End of hosts.
